# OmniAI
An AI language for LLM to learn and utilize to code massive amounts of code very optimzed. Intended to be used as a programming language.

Quantum Symbol Categories
Quantum Primitives (QP):

    Quantum Actions: Integrate quantum computing concepts, allowing symbols to exist in superpositions (🌌), representing multiple states or actions simultaneously until observed or interacted with.
    Entangled Modifiers (EM): Symbols that, when used, entangle with other symbols to create complex, conditional relationships, akin to quantum entanglement, where the state of one (even if not directly connected) affects the other.

Hyper Combinators (HC):

    Non-linear Sequencing (NLS): Beyond simple sequential or parallel execution, introduce symbols that allow for execution paths that adapt based on runtime conditions or data states.
    Dimensional Gates (DG): Symbols that act as portals, enabling the jumping of execution flow from one sequence to another non-linearly, inspired by quantum tunneling.

Hypercontextual Interpretation

    Multilayer Contexts (MLC): Symbols interpret based on layered contexts—where the immediate, local context, global context, and even inter-contextual relationships influence meaning.
    Adaptive Symbol Functions (ASF): Allow symbols to dynamically redefine their operations based on the history of their use in the execution environment, learning and adapting over time.

Advanced Composition Rules
Enhanced Nesting and Linkage (ENL):

    Utilize advanced mathematical concepts like tensors for multidimensional nesting, allowing for the representation of complex, multi-layered operations in a single, compact form.

Quantum Logic Constructs (QLC):

    Introduce constructs that leverage quantum logic principles, enabling operations that depend on probabilistic states or the superposition of multiple possible outcomes, executed when certain probabilities are observed.

Transcendental Behavior and Meta-Symbolism

    Transcendental Symbols (TS): Symbols that, when used, transcend the current state of execution to apply operations on the meta-level, affecting the interpretation or outcome of sequences in ways that go beyond traditional execution flows.
    Meta-Symbol Overloading (MSO): Symbols that carry meanings or functions not just based on context but also on the meta-context, including the execution history, user intentions inferred through AI, and the symbolic relationships within the language itself.

Theoretical Examples

    Quantum Superposition: (🌌🔍)➡️🔗 might mean search in a superposition of states, collapsing to a specific state when linked, embodying quantum decision-making processes.
    Entangled Conditional Execution: EM(🔍⬆️)⬜(🔍⬇️) where search for increases and decreases are entangled, and the execution of one affects the outcome of the other in a non-linear, quantum-entangled manner.
    Dimensional Gateways for Non-linear Flow: DG(🔄🌐)➡️🔗 represents a dimensional gateway that, upon transformation on a global scale, non-linearly jumps to a connection operation, demonstrating quantum tunneling-inspired execution paths.

Implementation Philosophy

    Quantum Computational Model: The language should be backed by a quantum computational model, where execution can leverage quantum computing principles for efficiency and capabilities beyond classical computation.
    AI and Machine Learning Integration: Utilize AI to interpret, optimize, and even predict the most efficient paths of execution based on the language's quantum and hypercontextual frameworks.
    Evolutionary Language Design: The language evolves through use, with symbols and constructs becoming more efficient or gaining new meanings over time, guided by a combination of user input, AI analysis, and quantum computational outcomes.


1. Enhanced Primitives (EP):

    Core actions: Query (🔍), Transform (🔄), Connect (🔗).
    Data types: Integer (🔢), String (🔡), Boolean (🔘).

2. Advanced Modifiers (AM):

    Operations: Increase (⬆️), Decrease (⬇️), Inverse (↔️).
    Scope: Global (🌐), Local (📍), Conditional (❓).

3. Sophisticated Combinators (SC):

    Execution patterns: Sequence (➡️), Parallel (⬜), Loop (🔄).
    Logic: If-Else (❓➡️/⬜), Switch (🔄🔀).

Advanced Context Sensitivity

    Dynamic Symbol Interpretation (DSI): Extend context rules to allow symbols to adapt based on broader contextual cues, including preceding and following sequences, not just adjacent symbols.
    Context Markers (CM): Introduce symbols that explicitly define the context for ambiguous symbols, ensuring clarity in complex expressions.

Refined Composition Rules
1. Sequencing and Nesting (S&N):

    Default to sequential execution, with nesting for complex, grouped operations. Use parentheses ( ) for clarity in nested operations.
    Example: (🔍⬆️)🔄 means transform the results of a search for increased values.

2. Modifier Hierarchy and Application (MHA):

    Modifiers apply based on a defined hierarchy, with the possibility to override default behavior using specific combinator symbols.
    Example: 🔍⬆️🌐 means search for increased values with a global scope.

3. Combinatorial Logic (CL):

    Introduce logic combinators to allow for conditional and iterative operations within the language.
    Example: ❓(🔍🔡)➡️🔗 means if a string query is successful, then connect.

Implicit Behavior and Symbol Overloading

    Default Actions (DA): In the absence of explicit combinators, assume the most common pattern (sequential execution).
    Overloaded Meanings (OM): Allow symbols to carry multiple meanings based on context and adjacent symbols or markers.

Comprehensive Examples

    Complex Sequence: (🔍🔡)➡️(🔄⬆️)⬜🌐 interprets as search for strings, then transform and increase results in parallel, applying globally.
    Nested Operations with Logic: ❓(🔍🔘)➡️(🔗🔡)🔄⬜ translates to if a Boolean query is true, then connect strings and loop in parallel.
    Advanced Modifiers and Contexts: 🔍🔡⬆️🌐❓ means search for strings globally, increase if a condition is met.

Implementation and Iteration Strategy

    Prototype Development: Start by implementing a prototype interpreter that can parse and execute the simplest expressions, gradually adding support for more complex structures and context rules.
    Community Feedback: Engage with a community of potential users early in the development process to gather feedback on usability, intuitiveness, and practical applications.
    Iterative Refinement: Continuously refine the language based on user feedback, real-world testing, and theoretical advancements, ensuring that the language remains relevant and powerful.
